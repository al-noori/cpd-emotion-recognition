# Change-Point Detection for Emotion Recognition
A study of two state-of-the-art unsupervised change-point detection algorithms on physiological data of participants in an HRI with the aim of emotion recognition. 

### Dataset 
We used the AFFECT-HRI dataset with about ~150 participants in a human-robot-interaction simulating a sales scene. The participants wear data modalities such as a wearable wristband to measure various physiological signals. The dataset can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/10422259.
